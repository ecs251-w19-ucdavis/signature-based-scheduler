1.	default scheduling algorithm is complete fair scheduling (CFS). —> fair.c
2.	In fair.c,
struct sched_class fair_sched_class = {
1.	/*
2.	 * All the scheduling class methods:
3.	 */
}

To Implementing new scheduler policy,
1.	Implement all the scheduling class methods
2.	Find where it is getting initialized,
In,  kernel/sched/core.c:sched_init()
Which is called from  
init/main.c:kernel_init_freeable():
Making changes to these files.
