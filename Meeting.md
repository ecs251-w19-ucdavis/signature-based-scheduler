# Meeting Report

- What we did this week?
  - Set up the simulator to experiment with linux changes
    \[Initally, tried to use latest linux kernel 4.19x. Had to let it go
    due to simulator bugs. Finally switched back to linux kernel 4.8x. \]
  - Went through few documents to understand kernel process scheduler.
  - Went through the scheduling related source code.
  - Added basic skeleton for a new (FIFO) scheduler. It is not fully functional yet.

- What we plan to do next week?
  - Make the basic FIFO scheduler working.
  - Implement some mroe complicated scheudling policies.
  - Profile some common cpu benchmarks to create application signatures.
