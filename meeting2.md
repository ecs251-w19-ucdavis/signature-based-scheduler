### What we did this week?
1. We completed setting up test scheduler and performed tests using multi-threaded application. We observed the following results:

![Normal Scheduler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8845039/53542959-aa3bc680-3ad5-11e9-9655-f490980c564d.jpeg)
Completely Fair Scheduler: It is observed that the two threads acquire CPU interchangable.

![Custom made FIFO Scheduler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8845039/53542902-6c3ea280-3ad5-11e9-88ec-54654e5ccbe8.jpeg)

Custom FIFO Scheduler: It is observed that the threads follow FIFO during execution.


2. We completed test profiling some applications to make the project transition to phase 2 smoothly and below are results we obtained.
