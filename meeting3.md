### What we did this week?
 - We have some progress towards the final application based scheduler, but it is not fully functional yet. We have 
   been having some issues related to performance evaluation of the scheduling due to some unexpected behavior from 
   the simulator (gem5), that we are using.


### What are we doing next Week?
  - Fix the simulation related issues and complete the scheduler implementation. 
  - Also, think about any other evaluation options, in case simulation issues persist.
